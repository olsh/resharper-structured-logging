An extension for ReSharper and Rider IDE that highlights structured logging templates and contains some useful analyzers

> [The highlighting is a built-in feature starting from R#/Rider 2021.2](https://github.com/olsh/resharper-structured-logging/issues/35#issuecomment-900883583), 
> but the extension still contains some useful analyzers that are not (yet) implemented by JetBrains team

At the moment it supports Serilog, NLog, and Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

* [Exception passed as a template argument](rules/ExceptionPassedAsTemplateArgumentProblem.md)   
* [Duplicate properties in a template](rules/TemplateDuplicatePropertyProblem.md)                
* [Template should be a compile-time constant](rules/TemplateIsNotCompileTimeConstantProblem.md) 
* [Prefer named properties instead of positional ones](rules/PositionalPropertyUsedProblem.md) 
* [Inconsistent log property naming](rules/InconsistentLogPropertyNaming.md) 
* [Inconsistent log property naming in context](rules/InconsistentContextLogPropertyNaming.md)

## Turning Off Analyzers

Individual analyzers can be disabled as needed either through code comments or by adding a line to a project's
`.editorconfig` file.

### Turning Off Via Comments

The analyzer name can be used as-is in a ReSharper comment to disable an analyzer on a per-file or per-line basis.
For example:

```csharp
// ReSharper disable once TemplateIsNotCompileTimeConstantProblem
```

### Turning Off Via `.editorconfig`

To disable an analyzer for an entire directory, you can add a line to a `.editorconfig` file
([learn more](https://editorconfig.org)). In this case, the analyzer name needs to be converted to `snake_case`, prefixed
with `resharper_` and suffixed with `_highlighting`. For example:

```editorconfig
resharper_template_is_not_compile_time_constant_problem_highlighting = none
```
